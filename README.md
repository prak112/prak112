## _Reaching the stars to..._
**Start as a Data Analyst in an Investment Bank, to eventually some day run an entire fund as a Fund Manager**

### _Wish to work in finance because..._
Developed a keen interest in financial perspective towards Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) initiatives through Erasmus University course (Principles of Sustainable Finance, Coursera).

  -  building an [ESG profiling dashboard](https://github.com/prak112/esg-profile.git) (still in its nascent stage) to feature the stock performance of the companies which "ethically" follow the standards of running a Sustainable organisation. 💝 **_my pet project_** 💓
