### Hi there! 😃👋
I am Prakirth. Currently, working on career transition towards Data Science. Started learning to code since March 2020. Since then working on updating skills on @freecodecamp & @datacamp. Gained methodical understanding of Data Science through IBM Data Science certification on Coursera in January 2021. 


### _Wish to work in finance because..._
Developed a keen interest in financial perspective towards Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) initiatives through Erasmus University course (Principles of Sustainable Finance, Coursera) in May 2021. To build on that contributed as a team (of 5) in a Sustainability Challenge by EKIPA (Innovation Platform)-KION Group (Organisation) based on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) from June 14 - September 8.
